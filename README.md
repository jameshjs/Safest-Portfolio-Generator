# AI-Driven Best-Profit Stock Portfolio with Indicators
The goal is to construct an AI-powered system for stock portfolio optimization. By leveraging technical indicators and machine learning, the system aims to maximize returns while managing risks effectively.

###  Key Components
##### 1. Data Acquisition
* Historical stock prices and financial data from Yahoo Finance API.
* Real-time daily data feeds for stock quotes and volumes.
* Technical indicators including RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
##### 2. Data Preprocessing
* Clean data to handle missing values and outliers.
* Compute technical indicators as features for modeling.
* Normalize and scale data for consistency.
* Tools: Pandas, NumPy, and sklearn.
##### 3. Feature Engineering
* Trend indicators: MACD.
* Momentum indicators: RSI.
* Volatility indicators: Bollinger Bands.
* Volume indicators: OBV.
* Feature Selection: Use correlation analysis, PCA to identify the most predictive features.
##### 4. Predictive Modeling
* Time-series model (LSTM) for price prediction.
* Classification models (XGBoost) for stock selection (buy/hold/sell).
* Training Data: Historical stock data with technical indicators.
* Tools: TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
##### 5. Portfolio Optimization
* Objective: Maximize the Sharpe Ratio while minimizing drawdown.
* Constraints:
    * Risk tolerance thresholds.
    * Sector and asset diversification requirements.
    * Liquidity constraints.
* Methods:
    * Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).
    * Reinforcement learning for dynamic rebalancing.
    * Tools: PyPortfolioOpt, CVXPY, or custom optimization scripts.
##### 6. Execution System
* Allocate capital to stocks based on optimization results.
* Monitor portfolio performance in real-time.
* Place trades using Alpaca APIs (or Interactive Brokers).
* Features:
    * Automated rebalancing based on new predictions and market movements.
    * Transaction cost minimization.
* Technologies: REST API integration and WebSocket for live updates.
##### 7. Evaluation and Monitoring
* Metrics:
    * Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio.
    * Portfolio returns and drawdown statistics.
    * Model accuracy, precision, and recall for predictions.
* Tools: Tableau, Matplotlib, or Plotly for performance visualizations.
